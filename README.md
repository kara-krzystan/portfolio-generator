# Module 9 Project: Portfolio Generator

## Description

In this module, I used node.js to build a program that creates a GitHub portfolio page using the command line to capture user input and place it in a JavaScript function that outputs a finished HTML page.

## Overview of Concepts Learned in Course Module

* Identify the purpose Node.js serves in modern web development and when to use it
* How to create and execute a Node.js application from the command line
* Outline the differences between the JavaScript syntax used thus far and the new ES6 features to understand the purpose they serve in JavaScript
* How to build interactive command-line applications that process user input using a third-party Node.js module
* Modularizing code into multiple files
